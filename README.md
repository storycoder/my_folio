== This is a simple portfolio App

* I've figured out how to do the core functionality with one model.

* The simple but key feature allows me to enter a name for a specific work sample along with an http and have those convert into a single hypertext link. I will use this feature to allow users who visit my portfolio to click through to my samples. There is also I text field called description for me to describe my project.

* There will be no additional show.html.erb page developed as visitors only need my description and link to my sample.

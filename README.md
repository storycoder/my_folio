== This is a simple portfolio App

* I've figured out how to do the core functionality with one model.

* The simple but key feature allows me to enter a name for a specific work sample along with an http and have those convert into a single hypertext link. I will use this feature to allow users who visit my portfolio to click through to my samples. There is also I text field called description for me to describe my project.

* There will be no additional show.html.erb page developed as visitors only need my description and link to my sample.

* I am using devise. I've never developed super user funcitionality to an app before and plan on challenging myself to do just that in this project. Everything else, I've pretty much figured out a way to solve.
